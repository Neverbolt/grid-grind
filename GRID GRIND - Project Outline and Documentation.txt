GRID GRIND - Project Outline and Documentation

Basic Idea
GridGrind is a basic over head movement game. The goal is to align the players
circular piece with the open circular posts located around the grid. The
grid is broken into increments along with the players piece can move.

The game starts with no enemies or obstacles, and at a fairly low speed. The
idea is that as the game gets further in, everything moves faster and faster.
I believe it would be best to develop it in a way that is repetitive, but
very difficult. In a way making it similar to the impossible quiz.

The games would be timed, and each level would add,
 -- Obstacles
 -- Enemies
 -- Larger increments or faster time
 -- Level ups or power accessories

The game would involve the following components
 -- Scorekeeper
   ** Total current score
   ** Total lives left
   ** Time left in level

 -- Player
 -- Posts
 -- Enemies
   ** Block entire grid lines for a period of time
   ** Move in a specific direction
   ** Converge on the player
   ** Leave trail of bombs behind them
