/*

Best Practices --
As more developers migrated to ECMAScript 6, an alternate approach gained popular-
ity: use const by default and only use let when you know a variableâ€™s value needs to change.
The rationale is that most variables should not change their value after initialization because
unexpected value changes are a source of bugs. This idea has a significant amount of traction
and is worth exploring in your code as you adopt ECMAScript 6.

    * CONST declarations are not hoisted.

   // It is also more efficient to use the LET declaration in for-in loops

   // Note that you can use CONST declarations in these loops as well. In a FOR loop
